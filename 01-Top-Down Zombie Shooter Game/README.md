This game was created utilizing C# and Windows Forms.

The controls :video_game: are as follows:

 :joystick: Movement is done utilizing your arrow keys (but can be changed to accomodate the WSAD players at heart) through some simple code changes.
 
 :gun: Shooting is done with the Space bar
 
 :repeat: Once the game is over, press Enter to restart :rage2:


 -You begin the game with 15 rounds of ammo, 0 kills, and a full health bar. 
 
 -As you shoot, the ammo will go down and once it reaches zero, it will respawn ammo pickups in multiples of 5. 
 
 -Every time a zombie touches you, you lose a health point, once dead you can't move, shoot, or do anything really so restart the game and try again.
